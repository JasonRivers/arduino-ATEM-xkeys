/*****************
 * TO MAKE THIS EXAMPLE WORK:
 * - You must have an Arduino with Ethernet Shield (or compatible such as "Arduino Ethernet", http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEthernet)
 * - You must have an Atem Switcher connected to the same network as the Arduino - and you should have it working with the desktop software
 * - You must make specific set ups in the below lines where the comment "// SETUP" is found!
